### Create files for the web app
- Create an HTML file
  - This HTML code is a web page for a Security Control Inventory application. It uses Bootstrap for styling and includes a form to enter control details, action buttons for updating controls, and a table to display control information. The page integrates custom CSS for additional styling and relies on JavaScript functions to manage data interactions.

  - validateForm(): Validates form fields for completeness, alerts for missing information, and returns true if valid, false otherwise.

  - showData(): Populates HTML table with control information, retrieving data from local storage.

  - AddData(): Adds a new control to controlList if form is valid, checks for duplicate Main Control IDs, updates local storage, and refreshes table.

  - deleteData(index): Deletes a control at specified index, confirming deletion before updating.

  - updateData(index): Enables control data editing in the UI, highlights selected row, disables delete buttons, updates controlList after validation, refreshes table, and clears form on successful update.

  - downloadCSV(): Creates CSV data from HTML table, generates downloadable CSV file, and releases object URL after download.
